<p>Dragone Construction came to me with a need for a basic website.&nbsp; They wanted to show mostly photos of their work and have some basic information available to perspective clients.&nbsp; I delivered this via J!1.0, JoGadgets, CSS and Illustrator.&nbsp; The end product is a simple yet easy to use website, with an animated gallery.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>J!1.0</li><li>Lightbox</li><li>Simple site, quick turn around</li><li>Value driven project</li></ul>
