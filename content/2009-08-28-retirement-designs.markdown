<p>Retirement Designs was referred to me by an associate. On their 3rd website in five years, they were really in need of a site that fit their budget given the expense they'd already absorbed.&nbsp; <br /><br />I sat with <strong>RD</strong> management and came up with a plan that met their expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp; We needed to discover what it was that they ultimately would like their website to do for them.&nbsp; They already had a considerable amount of poorly marked up content, and they wanted to move towards a "2.0" style layout. The site was to be content managed, but it couldn't break the bank on development time.</p><ul><li>Complex UI, utilizing, Tooltips, accordion, Thickbox, Lots of custom triggers</li><li>4 Joomla! Templates</li><li>Custom Joomla FAQ</li><li>Had to fit their existing marketing but be modernized</li></ul>
