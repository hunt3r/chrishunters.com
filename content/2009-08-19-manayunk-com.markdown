<p>Manayunk Development Corporate was looking for a way to manage their directory of supporting businesses.&nbsp; They wanted to create a prefered directory for these companies to be listed.&nbsp; After some research, I again settled on Joomla as having the most flexible module selection for their basic business needs.</p><p>As a subcontractor of Lauren Innella of <a href="http://www.innelladesign.com" target="_blank" title="InnellaDesign">Innella Design Studio</a> I was contracted to build a cms driven website.&nbsp; Lauren was the lead, and dealt with the client and deligated tasks as necessary.&nbsp; She gave me approximately 10 templates, and a list of requirements.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>A Custom business directory, based off mtree, but heavily modified</li><li>8 Custom templates</li><li>Extended menu system, with roll overs</li><li>Weather</li><li>Newsletter Manager</li></ul><p><em>Note: this client has managed the site since 2006, and I have not been involved with it since it launched.&nbsp; Several web designers have done some major damage to it, and it looks pretty bad right now!</em></p>
