I've been highly involved in the Philadelphia mountain biking community for about 4 years now.

It's something that I do which keeps my mind in a good place, and allows me to relieve the stresses of the work week.

Plus it allows me to connect with my past and get close to that feeling of racing motocross, and the freedom that brings.
