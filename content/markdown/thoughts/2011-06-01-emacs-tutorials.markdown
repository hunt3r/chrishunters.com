Hey all,

I do a lot of development right on the server these days. I've always been an emacs user while editting in the Terminal. Something about VI modes just rubs me the wrong way or maybe I'm just not wired to be able to switch between editting modes efficiently. So I deal with the [Emacs Pinky](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?EmacsPinky) like everyone else who uses Emacs. But I found that (and still am finding) that there is so much more you can do with Emacs. I'm just going to be compiling useful Emacs links here for my (and potentially your) benefit. You're welcome ;~).
