Manayunk Development Corporate was looking for a way to manage their directory of supporting businesses. They wanted to create a prefered directory for these companies to be listed. After some research, I again settled on Joomla as having the most flexible module selection for their basic business needs.

As a subcontractor of Lauren Innella of [Innella Design Studio](http://www.innelladesign.com "InnellaDesign") I was contracted to build a cms driven website. Lauren was the lead, and dealt with the client and deligated tasks as necessary. She gave me approximately 10 templates, and a list of requirements.

*   A Custom business directory, based off mtree, but heavily modified
*   8 Custom templates
*   Extended menu system, with roll overs
*   Weather
*   Newsletter Manager

This client has managed the site since 2006, and I have not been involved with it since it launched. Several web designers have done some major damage to it.
