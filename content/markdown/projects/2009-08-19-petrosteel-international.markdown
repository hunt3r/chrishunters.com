Petrosteel International _(Now a division of Edgen Murray Steel)_, formerly of Bala Cynwyd is a full service steel logistics company.
 With clients all over the world they needed a website that helped them communicate more efficiently with their customers abroad.


One of the top priorities for this project was a website that could support multiple languages in a data driven way.
 I was able to satisify this using Joomla! and it's vast array of succulent modules for multi-lingual support.
 JoomlaFish was one of the first modules to be installed.
 We worked with a writer to translate all of their business concerns into German, Chinese and of course English.

They wanted a template that would work on all legacy browsers, including IE6, which is no easy task.
 We ended up with 3 variations on their main template, a homepage, category overview, and a detail template.
 Each retaining a standard header and top level navigation, but opting for 2nd level links to be in the left hand column.
 We wanted to stay away from drop down menus.


We made a custom Flex calculator to aide their customers in their calculations on weight and density, abrasion resistence, etc...
 Pretty cool stuff!

*   Advanced Joomla! configuration
*   3 Custom Templates
*   Three languages (German, English, Chinese)
*   RTL support
*   Customer Training
