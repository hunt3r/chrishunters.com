Retirement Designs was referred to me by an associate. On their 3rd website in five years, they were really in need of a site that fit their budget given the expense they'd already absorbed. 

I sat with **RD** management and came up with a plan that met their expectations. We needed to discover what it was that they ultimately would like their website to do for them. They already had a considerable amount of poorly marked up content, and they wanted to move towards a "2.0" style layout. The site was to be content managed, but it couldn't break the bank on development time.

*   Complex UI, utilizing, Tooltips, accordion, Thickbox, Lots of custom triggers
*   4 Joomla! Templates
*   Custom Joomla FAQ
*   Had to fit their existing marketing but be modernized
