<div><blockquote><p>Bike Temple is a University-wide program to promote bicycle use by Temple students, faculty, and staff.&nbsp; The overall goal of the program is to enable more people to travel on a bike and to do so safely, to build a great bike culture at Temple that supports the University’s commitment to sustainability and reputation for innovative, green programs.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Temple community is becoming increasingly bike oriented, and a geographical analysis of current faculty and staff addresses confirms the potential for increasing bicycles as a form of transportation, including commuting to Temple campuses; over 3,300 faculty and staff, or 31%,&nbsp; live within four miles of Main Campus, over 5,100, or 48%, live within six miles of Main Campus.&nbsp; While student address information is not readily available, we do know that there are thousands of students living a “bikeable” distance from the University.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div>
