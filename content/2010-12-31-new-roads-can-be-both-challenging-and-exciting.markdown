<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Starting just about anything new can bring stress and anxiety into one’s life. &nbsp;It doesn’t matter what it might be, new city, new job, new school, new apartment, new diet. All of these things can cause a certain amount of stress and anxiety in one’s life when the change happens. &nbsp;It also will likely cause a certain amount of liberation from the previous circumstances, which are usually what leads to the change to begin with. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I try to challenge myself often, to see how I’ll react and to realize the unforeseen benefits of change. &nbsp;No matter how much I analyze some choices in life (thorough analysis is helpful), there are always positives that I never even considered. That’s why it’s so important to always be open to new things and new opportunities when they arise. This is why I’m trying to look at change as a good thing. </span><span class="c0 c10">If I’m doing what I’m supposed to be doing</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c0 c8">then usually change will push me in the right direction.</span></p><h2 class="c2 c9 heading2"><span class="c7">Why I gave job security a back seat</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In October 2010, I had been working at Large University as a senior software developer for about two and a half years and I probably could have stayed my entire career there. &nbsp;The thing I realized once I’d been working at

recession proof</a></span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;And as such, it’s a really secure place to work. &nbsp;It also has major, major benefits if you’re in a position to capitalize: over 40, minimal

think they would have the resources to keep the employees, who were doing the heavy lifting, happy. &nbsp;Obviously, the benefits are an important part of this equation, but if you’re a young person, who has no children, some student loans and no aspirations of additional degrees, it falls short. &nbsp;Not everyone fits into one box and different compensation packages for different situations might make more sense in the long run.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I’m proud of the work I was_able_to accomplish there, we did some pretty big projects that made a real difference, and
