I decided to round up a bunch of the photos from my motocross racing days and put them up in a gallery. I put them in Chronological order with captions, the captions are viewable on each photo.

I personally think these years were some of the most vital to my personal/professional development. Most people don't realize the dedication is takes to race at this level. I want to thank my parents and all my sponsors over the years for making these memories possible. Some special thanks go out to not in any particular order, and obviously in different years:
