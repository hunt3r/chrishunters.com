I decided to round up a bunch of the photos from my motocross racing days and put them up in a gallery. I put them in Chronological order with captions, the captions are viewable on each photo.

I personally think these years were some of the most vital to my personal/professional development. Most people don't realize the dedication is takes to race at this level. I want to thank my parents and all my sponsors over the years for making these memories possible. Some special thanks go out to not in any particular order, and obviously in different years:

* Mom, Dad, Steve, Ashley and Ted**
* Bergers Honda in Flemington NJ
* Dunlop Tires (In particular Brian Fleck)
* AXO Sport (Sharon Richards in particular)
* Manchester Honda Racing (Al Cordner)
* Factory Connection
* PJ1 Oils
* WD-40
* No Fear (David Solomon)
* Maxima
* Acerbis
* Renthal
* Pro Spec, Aktive, Reaktive, Aktive Reed systems (Al Carr)
* FMF
* Pro-Circuit
* Works Connection
* The Kucowski Family
* Jeff Dunlap
* Scott USA
* Action Photos
* M2R helmets
* Powermist Race Fuels
* NGK Spark Plugs
* Twin Air (Jeremy Garges)

It takes a team to make any successful venture come off the ground. My team was solid.

Photos are in Chronological Ordering
