Petrosteel International _(Now a division of Edgen Murray Steel)_, formerly of Bala Cynwyd is a full service steel logistics company.</p> 
 With clients all over the world they needed a website that helped them communicate more efficiently with their customers abroad.</p> 


One of the top priorities for this project was a website that could support multiple languages in a data driven way.</p> 
 I was able to satisify this using Joomla! and it's vast array of succulent modules for multi-lingual support.</p> 
 JoomlaFish was one of the first modules to be installed.</p> 
 We worked with a writer to translate all of their business concerns into German, Chinese and of course English.

They wanted a template that would work on all legacy browsers, including IE6, which is no easy task.</p> 
 We ended up with 3 variations on their main template, a homepage, category overview, and a detail template.</p> 
 Each retaining a standard header and top level navigation, but opting for 2nd level links to be in the left hand column.</p> 
 We wanted to stay away from drop down menus.</p> 


We made a custom Flex calculator to aide their customers in their calculations on weight and density, abrasion resistence, etc...</p> 
 Pretty cool stuff!
