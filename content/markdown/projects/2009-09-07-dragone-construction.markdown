Dragone Construction came to me with a need for a basic website. 

They wanted to show mostly photos of their work and have some basic information available to perspective clients. 

I delivered this via J!1.0, JoGadgets, CSS and Illustrator. 

The end product is a simple yet easy to use website, with an animated gallery.
