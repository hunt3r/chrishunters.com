Bike Temple is a University-wide program to promote bicycle use by Temple students, faculty, and staff.
 
The overall goal of the program is to enable more people to travel on a bike and to do so safely, to build a great bike culture at Temple that supports the University’s commitment to sustainability and reputation for innovative, green programs.

The Temple community is becoming increasingly bike oriented, and a geographical analysis of current faculty and staff addresses confirms the potential for increasing bicycles as a form of transportation, including commuting to Temple campuses; over 3,300 faculty and staff, or 31%, live within four miles of Main Campus, over 5,100, or 48%, live within six miles of Main Campus.

While student address information is not readily available, we do know that there are thousands of students living a “bikeable” distance from the University.
