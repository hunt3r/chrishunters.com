<p>Hey all,</p><p>I do a lot of development right on the server these days.&nbsp; I've always been an emacs user while editting in the Terminal.&nbsp; Something about VI modes just rubs me the wrong way or maybe I'm just not wired to be able to switch between editting modes efficiently.&nbsp; So I deal with the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?EmacsPinky">Emacs Pinky</a> like everyone else who uses Emacs.&nbsp; But I found that (and still am finding) that there is so much more you can do with Emacs.&nbsp; I'm just going to be compiling useful Emacs links here for my (and potentially your) benefit.&nbsp; You're welcome ;~).</p><ul><li>http://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/tcl-course/emacs-tutorial.html</li><li>http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/</li><li>http://cmgm.stanford.edu/classes/unix/emacs.html</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
