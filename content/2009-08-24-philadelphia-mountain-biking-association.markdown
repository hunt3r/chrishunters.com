<p>PMBA, a chartered IMBA chapter club, is a charitable non-profit 501(c)(3) organization based in Philadelphia Pennsylvania.</p> 


<p>PMBA is an organized group of mountain biking enthusiasts who share a common love of the sport and a desire to promote it. We are composed of all levels and types of riders, young and old, many of whom enjoy volunteering to build and maintain trails as much as we enjoy riding on them.</p> 
<p>I have been involved with PMBA since day one.&nbsp; I was at the first meeting when IMBA came to Manayunk to give the presentation about what their core values are.&nbsp; I helped form the board of directors and executive committee.&nbsp; I participate in trail maintenance once a month at the Wissahickon park.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Currently I hold a position on the board of directors, for which I am one of 13.&nbsp; I manage all web related duties as the chair of the marketing and web committee.</p> 
<p>Duties include:</p> 
<ul> <li>Engineering their website / CMS</li> <li>Member fullfilment automation via CMS</li> <li>Maintenance of LAMP environment</li> <li>Apply all patches to core modules and components as issued by the community</li> <li>Google Apps Domain setup/implementation</li> <li>C# driven user and group provisioning for managing our member services</li> <li>Attend board of directors meetings (As a board member and VP)</li></ul>
