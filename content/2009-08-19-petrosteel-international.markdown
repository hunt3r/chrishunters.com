<p>Petrosteel International <em>(Now a division of Edgen Murray Steel)</em>, formerly of Bala Cynwyd is a full service steel logistics company.&nbsp; With clients all over the world they needed a website that helped them communicate more efficiently with their customers abroad.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the top priorities for this project was a website that could support multiple languages in a data driven way.&nbsp; I was able to satisify this using Joomla! and it's vast array of succulent modules for multi-lingual support.&nbsp; JoomlaFish was one of the first modules to be installed.&nbsp; We worked with a writer to translate all of their business concerns into German, Chinese and of course English.</p><p>They wanted a template that would work on all legacy browsers, including IE6, which is no easy task.&nbsp; We ended up with 3 variations on their main template, a homepage, category overview, and a detail template.&nbsp; Each retaining a standard header and top level navigation, but opting for 2nd level links to be in the left hand column.&nbsp; We wanted to stay away from drop down menus.&nbsp;</p><p>We made a custom Flex calculator to aide their customers in their calculations on weight and density, abrasion resistence, etc...&nbsp; Pretty cool stuff!</p><ul><li>Advanced Joomla! configuration</li><li>3 Custom Templates</li><li>Three languages (German, English, Chinese)</li><li>RTL support</li><li>Customer Training</li></ul>
