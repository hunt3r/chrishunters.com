<p>I've been highly involved in the Philadelphia mountain biking community for about 5 years now.&nbsp; It's something that I do which keeps my mind in a good place, and allows me to relieve the stresses of the work week.&nbsp; Plus it allows me to connect with my past and get close to that feeling of racing motocross, and the freedom that brings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
