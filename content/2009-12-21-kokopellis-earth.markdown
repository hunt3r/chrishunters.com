<p>Sometimes I get requests from friends to help them with a business they're trying to get started.  Often times when someone is considering how to get going, one of the first bullet points is "Create a basic website".  I met with my friend and helped him figure out what pieces of his business process he could efficiently and feasibly do within his budget. In this discussion it became clear that as a art and music venue he needed to:</p><ul><li>

    Broadcast events</li><li>Allow annonymous event registrations </li><li>Blog </li><li>Add photo galleries to any piece of content </li><li>Have an organized calendar

</li></ul><p>We came up with a modest proposal to achieve this with miminal effort using the Drupal framework. Drupal development makes this site possible within a value minded customer.  We were able to achieve all of these features with no custom coding for functionality. </p><p>

Custom work: </p><ul><li>Modified Garland theme (CSS, Javascript)</li></ul>
