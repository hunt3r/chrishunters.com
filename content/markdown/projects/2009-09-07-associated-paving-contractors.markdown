Associated Paving Contractors has an extensive website catalog of services. They do everything from large highway paving jobs, to small driveways, septic tank removals, and just about anything environmental. They came to me with very little vision and had been burned before. We came up with a value minded proposal and a reasonable timeline. We hired a writer to help with the content development and overal things went very smoothly.
