###I like Markdown

I have really grown to despise typing HTML into a textbox on a website.  Even worse is typing text into an online wysiwyg editor.  The HTML those editors produces is jenky at best.  Enter markdown.

There are a bunch of static site generators out there that produce static documents from markdown and do a great job.  Projects like Jekyll (ruby), Pelican (Python), do a fine job of this.  The thing that I am less impressed with is their ability to create adhoc collections of data.  They are also not as good for creating single page apps that consume this markdown content.  So I really was aiming to create a piece of software that could consume markdown and create a document collection with rich meta data to query from.
